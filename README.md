## 🤔 Motive <a name = "motive"></a>

I spend most of my day in front of my 🧑🏻‍💻. So, i have to sit at one place for too long hours. And it's not good for my health (I'm feeling it 😒).

So, i need something/someone to remind me frequently that i need to take short breaks after some interval of time (for stretching or for refreshment).

So, i developed this script.

Hope it will help you too 🥰
